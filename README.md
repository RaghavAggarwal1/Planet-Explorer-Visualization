# Planet Explorer Visualization - Innovative Visualization Design

This bubble chart visualizes different types of planets discovered from 1995-2022, based on their distance from Earth in Light-years (upto 6000 Light-year from Earth).
Radius of each planet is proportional to the planets real radius, The stellar magnitude/Brightness of the planet is represented by the opacity of color. Higher the Brightnes, higher is the opacity.
The color of each bubble represents the type of planet. A legend at the bottom right indicates the meaning of each color.
Inside each bubble, there is a doughnut chart that shows the proportion of the planet's mass and radius compared to the total mass and radius of planets in our solar system.
The chart has a tooltip that displays all the information of the selected planet when hovered over the planet(bubble) and the doughnut chart.
Data can also be filtered by planet type, distance, and discovery year, from the Control Panel

## Marks:
* "innovative" view - that features a Bubble chart with each bubble containing a Doughnut Chart
* Tooltip

## Channels:
* X-Axis (Year of Discovery)
* Y-Axis (Distance from Earth in Light-years)
* Bubble size (Planet Radius)
* Bubble opacity (Stellar Magnitude)
* Bubble color (Planet Type)
* Doughnut Chart slices (Planet Mass and Radius wrt to total Mass and Radius of all planets in our solar system)

## Interactions:
* Hover over a bubble to show all the information of the selected planet
* Hover over the doughnut chart to show the information of the selected pie. (Planet Mass/Radius wrt to total Mass/Radius of all planets in our solar system)

## Personal Note:
This visualization provides a detalied and interactive view of planetary systems, allowing the user to compare and contrast various types of planets based on their properties.
Futhermore, The doughnut chart inside each bubble provides additional details about the planet's mass and radius, making it easier to understand the relative sizes of different planets.
Overall, this visualization is an effective way to explore and learn about the lesser known discovered planets.
